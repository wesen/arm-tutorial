ARM tutorial
------------

This is a collection of simple bare-metal ARM software for the
AT91SAM7S256 platform. This started out as a rewrite of James P
Lynch's at91 blink tutorial, and is getting expanded to support C++
and other features. It's basically me getting to know the
architecture, and hopefully having a working C++ USB stack at the end.
